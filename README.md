Multi-Agent System (MAS) for Weekly Shopping List Creation

This MAS helps users generate a customized weekly shopping list with three meals per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for two people. The system operates through four specialized agents:
> Analyst Agent    : Gathers user preferences, dietary restrictions, and budget requirements.
> Researcher Agent : Collects recipes, ingredients, and nutritional data based on the given preferences.
> Summary Agent    : Organizes meal plans, consolidates ingredient lists, and optimizes the shopping list.
> Reporting Agent  : Presents the final meal plan and shopping list to the user, evaluates feasibility, and provides recommendations.

The MAS ensures variety, nutritional balance, and cost-efficiency in meal planning, making it easier for users to shop and prepare meals throughout the week.
