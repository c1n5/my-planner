## Final Answer: 
Comprehensive Dietary Preference Report**

1. **Detailed Nutritional Guidelines**:
   - **Protein**: Include lean sources such as Chicken and Pork Loin, providing essential amino acids while remaining low in saturated fat.
   - **Vegetables**: Incorporate high-fiber vegetables like Celery, Carrot, and Broccoli to enhance digestive health and satiety.
   - **Healthy Fats**: Opt for moderate amounts of healthy fats sourced from Hummus (made with chickpeas and tahini) which can contribute to heart health.
   - **Dairy Alternatives**: Employ Almond Milk as a calcium-enriched, dairy-free milk alternative when necessary for recipes, ensuring no added sugars.
   - **Vinegar**: Use Apple Cider Vinegar, noted for its potential benefits in aiding digestion and promoting feelings of fullness, in salad dressings or as a marinade.

2. **Personalized Eating Profile**:
   - Meals should focus on a balance of protein, fiber-rich carbohydrates, and healthy fats while maintaining appropriate portion sizes to support weight loss goals.
   - Emphasize whole-food preparation methods such as grilling, steaming, or roasting to maintain nutrient quality and flavor.

3. **Nutritional Constraint Matrix**:
